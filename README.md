To run my code, call the EcsBandAid class's main method.
This main method has the parameters (String[] args) where args is an array that only contains strings.
This array should only contain the following three strings in the following order {"musicians.txt", "compositions.txt", "years"}.
musicians.txt should be the name of the text file containing the musicians.
compositions.txt should be the name of the text file containing the compositions.
years should be a number, which will be the number of years that the orchestra/band performs for.
